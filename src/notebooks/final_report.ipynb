    "\n",
    "Predicting whether someone has a high income or not can provide valuable insights for various organizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Government Aid Programs**: In the UK, the government lacks a centralized income tracking system. Understanding the features that predict income could help determine eligibility for welfare programs such as the Winter Fuel Payment allowance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Charities**: Some door-to-door charities use age as a proxy for income when identifying potential donors. This analysis could validate such assumptions and reveal additional predictive features. (See [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1deg1fg/charity_not_allowed_to_speak_to_anyone_under_the/) for context.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Financial Services**: Accountants and financial advisers typically see lower demand from individuals with lower incomes, making income prediction useful for targeting their services effectively e.g. ads on sites that have detailed personal information, such as Facebook."
