    "### Outlier Handling Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers detected above (particularly in `capital-gain`, `capital-loss`, and `age`) are **retained** for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Domain validity**: Extreme capital gains/losses represent genuine high-net-worth individuals, which is the population we're trying to identify for the >USD50K prediction task. Removing them would bias the model against detecting high earners.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model robustness**: \n",
    "   - LGBM is tree-based and inherently robust to outliers (splits on rank, not magnitude)\n",
    "   - GLM uses regularisation which reduces sensitivity to extreme values\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Information loss**: Outliers in income-related features likely carry strong predictive signal. A person with USD99,999 capital gains is almost certainly a high earner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative considered**: Winsorisation was considered but rejected as it would artificially cap some signals that appear most predictive of high income.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Data Imputation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains missing values in three categorical columns: `workclass`, `occupation`, and `native_country`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy chosen: Impute with \"missing\" category**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Approach | Rationale |\n",
    "|----------|-----------|\n",
    "| Categorical, stays missing | Missingness may be informative e.g. someone unwilling to disclose occupation or work class could correlate with income |\n",
    "| Numeric, use median | Median is robust to outliers (unlike mean). Used inside sklearn pipeline to avoid information leakage.  |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternatives considered:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Alternative | Why rejected |\n",
    "|-------------|--------------|\n",
    "| Drop rows with missing values | Would lose ~7% of data; missingness may not be random, so we lose potential predictor information |\n",
    "| Drop columns with missing values | Would lose whole features, again we lose potential predictor information  |"

    "**Numeric Features:**\n",
    "| Feature | Rationale |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|\n",
    "| `age` | Strong correlation with income; clear pattern showing income peaks mid-career |\n",
    "| `education` | Ordinal encoding preserves natural ordering; higher education correlates with higher income |\n",
    "| `capital_net` | Combined capital gains/losses; strong indicator of investment income |\n",
    "| `hours_per_week` | Distinguishes full-time from part-time workers, as well as workers working beyond expected full-time hours |\n",
    "| `is_female` | Binary encoding of sex; captures gender pay gap effects |\n",
    "| `is_white`, `is_black` | Binary encoding of race; captures demographic income disparitie; This method captures three categories of race, White, Black, and Other  |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Categorical Features:**\n",
    "| Feature | Rationale |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|\n",
    "| `work_class` | Employment type (private, government, self-employed) affects income distribution |\n",
    "| `occupation` | Strong predictor; executive and professional roles correlate with high income |\n",
    "| `relationship` | Marital/household status correlates with income |\n",
    "| `native_country` | May capture geographic/economic origin effects |\n",
