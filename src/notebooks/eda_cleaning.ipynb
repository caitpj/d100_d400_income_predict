    "### Outlier Handling Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers detected above (particularly in `capital-gain`, `capital-loss`) represent genuine high-net-worth individuals. Removing them would bias the model against the very people we aim to detect. However, leaving them raw creates two problems:\n",
    "1.  **Skew:** The extreme values (e.g., 99,999) heavily skew the distribution, which negatively impacts the GLM's convergence and performance.\n",
    "2.  **Scale:** The magnitude of these values dwarfs other features like age (0-90), causing the model to disproportionately weight capital features or fail to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy Chosen: Transformation (Signed Log + Scaling)**\n",
    "Instead of removing or capping (Winsorising) these outliers, I handle them during the feature engineering phase of the modelling pipeline.\n",
    "- I will apply a custom `SignedLogTransformer`. This compresses the massive spread of capital values while preserving zero values and the critical distinction between gains (positive) and losses (negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Data Imputation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains missing values in three categorical columns: `workclass`, `occupation`, and `native_country`.\n",

    "**Strategy chosen: Impute with \"missing\" category**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Approach | Rationale |\n",
    "|----------|-----------|\n",
    "| Categorical, stays missing | Missingness may be informative e.g. someone unwilling to disclose occupation or work class could correlate with income |\n",
    "| Numeric, use median | Median is robust to outliers (unlike mean). Used inside sklearn pipeline to avoid information leakage.  |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternatives considered:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Alternative | Why rejected |\n",
    "|-------------|--------------|\n",
    "| Drop rows with missing values | Would lose ~7% of data; missingness may not be random, so we lose potential predictor information |\n",
    "| Drop columns with missing values | Would lose whole features, again we lose potential predictor information  |"

    "| `education` | Ordinal encoding preserves natural ordering; higher education correlates with higher income |\n",

    "| `hours_per_week` | Distinguishes full-time from part-time workers, as well as workers working beyond expected full-time hours |\n",
    "| `is_female` | Binary encoding of sex; captures gender pay gap effects |\n",
    "| `is_white`, `is_black` | Binary encoding of race; captures demographic income disparitie; This method captures three categories of race, White, Black, and Other  |\n",
